/**
 * This functional for accepting or rejecting commands executed against an out of date view.
 * An incoming command has a <code>readSequence</code>, which represents the clients view of the aggregate version.
 * This sequence is checked against the sequence of the internally maintained aggregate version, which is guaranteed to be the latest.
 * The <code>shouldReject</code> method will be invoked if and only if these versions do not agree
 *
 * Normally a client should not have to explicitly implement this interface. There are standard implementations that cover most use cases
 * These are provided by choosing the appropriate <code>InvalidSequenceStrategy</code> when using the <code>AggregateBuilder</code> DSL.
 *
 * @param <K> the aggregate key type
 * @param <C> the command type
